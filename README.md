## Red Team Activity 24  

This project is a comprehensive penetration testing exercise to successfully exploit and gain access to a vulnerable machine.   

We will then use actual data gathered in our exploitation activities and our preconfigured Kibana alerts to see if we can find solutions to exploit stealthily and avoid detection.
